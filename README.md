# **Loan Prediction**
Loan Prediction is a project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various factors such as credit score, income, and loan amount. The goal of this project is to help banks and financial institutions automate the loan approval process and reduce the time and effort required for manual processing.

This project uses machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model based on historical loan application data. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each loan application is labeled as approved or rejected. The trained model is then used to predict the approval status of new loan applications.

# **Requirements**
* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

# **Getting Started**
* Clone the repository: ``` git clone https://github.com/psychopass-me/CodeClause_Loan_Prediction.git```

* Install the required dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Download the dataset: You can download the loan prediction dataset from Kaggle or any other source.
* Train the model: Run ``` python train.py --data_path path/to/dataset --model_path path/to/save/model```
* Make predictions: Run ``` python predict.py --data_path path/to/new/data --model_path path/to/trained/model```

# **Dataset**
The loan prediction dataset contains information about loan applicants, including their credit score, income, loan amount, and other factors that may influence loan approval. The dataset should be divided into a training set and a test set for model evaluation.

# **Training**
To train the model, run python train.py with the following arguments:

* --data_path: Path to the training dataset.
* --model_path: Path to save the trained model.
* --algorithm: Machine learning algorithm to use (e.g. logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).
* --test_size: Proportion of data to use for testing.
* --random_state: Random seed for reproducibility.
# **Inference**
To make predictions for new loan applications, run python predict.py with the following arguments:

* --data_path: Path to the new loan application data.
* --model_path: Path to the trained model.
# **Evaluation**
To evaluate the performance of the model, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used. You can use the scikit-learn library in Python to calculate these metrics.
